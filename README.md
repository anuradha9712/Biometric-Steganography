# Biometric-Steganography

### Steganography:
It is the technique of concealing the secret data in to the one of the cover files, so that no one can suspect the data apart from the sender and receiver.

### Image Steganography: 
Taking the cover object as image in steganography is known as image steganography. Generally, in this technique pixel intensities are used to hide the information.

### Biometric Steganography:
This project is divided into 4 phases:
- Feature Extraction
- Key generation
- Data Embedding
- Data Extraction
